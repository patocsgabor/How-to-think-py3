# 7. You look at the clock and it is exactly 2pm. You set an alarm to go off in 51 hours. At what time does the alarm go off? (Hint: you    # could count on your fingers, but this is not what weâ€™re after. If you are tempted to count on your fingers, change the 51 to 5100.)

# 8. Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and ask for the    # number of hours to wait. Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off.




time = int(input('Time now : '))        # the time now in hours (24 hours daytime)
waking = int(input('Waking up : '))     # the number of hours to wait for the alarm

print((waking % 24) + time % 24)        # print the time when the alarm will ring
