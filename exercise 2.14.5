# The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning compound interest is given on Wikipedia as
# A = P * (1 + r/n)**n*t formula for compound interest.

# Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of $10000 to variable P, assign to n the value 12, and assign to r the interest # rate of 8%. Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years t that the money will be compounded for. Calculate and print # # the final amount after t years.




p = 10000                             # principal amount
r = 0.08                              # annual nominal interest rate 
n = 12                                # number of times the interest is compounden per year
t =float(input("Years: "))            # number of years
a = p * (1 + r/n)**n*t                

print("Money:", a)
